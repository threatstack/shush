# Contribution Guidelines

## Pull requests
Please file all pull requests with `dev` as the target branch. Releases will be
based off of master. Because of our use of Github pages for this repository
for hosting generated documentation, we would like to keep
documentation consistent with the latest release instead of development builds.

## Testing
Pull requests must include tests for the added feature and all tests must pass.
Testing is handled by Travis CI.

## Documentation
Documentation is autogenerated for each release and must be included for all
additions. Missing documentation will cause an error in the build to enforce this
behavior.

## Issues
For feature requests or bugs, please use the Github repository `Issues` section.

## Licensing of contributions
All contributions will be licensed under the BSD 3-Clause License and the
copyright specified in the license file.
